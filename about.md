<h2>Hello,</h2>

I am Has, I am a full-time software development consultant, a part-time researcher, an author, a blogger, a cyclist, and a not-too-great entrepreneur. I have about one decade of commercial experience, and I enjoy developing software, adding value, and improving/optimising processes and solutions.

I have a Master degree from Monash University (2010) and a Bachelor of Computer Engineering from the University of Technology (Baghdad &#8211; 2004). At work, you find me developing for cloud (mostly MS Azure), web (mostly MS ASP.NET), and mobile (iOS, Android, and Windows using Xamarin). When I am not working, sometimes you find me speaking at local user groups, presenting in conferences, or trying to hack something &#8211; arguably cool ðŸ™‚ -. I am currently working as an Independent Contractor.
