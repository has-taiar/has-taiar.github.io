<span>Azure Monthly News - November 2018 (from Melbourne Azure Meetup)</span>

<blockquote><p>The Azure Monthly News Summary is a monthly post and slide deck that we prepare for our community at the Azure Melbourne Meetup. I am a co-organiser of this meetup and it happens monthly on the second Wednesday of each month. If you missed last month, you can check out the news update <a href="https://www.hasaltaiar.com.au/azure-monthly-news-summary-september-2018">here</a></p></blockquote>

Hi again, here is the summary of Azure news from the last four weeks. This is brought to you by Melbourne Azure Meetup, which I am a co-organiser of :) There is a lot to cover, so let's get started.
