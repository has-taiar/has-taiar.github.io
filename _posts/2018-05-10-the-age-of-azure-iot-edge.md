Azure IoT Edge is a great offering by Microsoft that simplifies building, deploying, and monitoring code modules for IoT Edge devices. Last night I gave a talk at Melbourne Azure meetup about Azure IoT Edge. I have put the slides here for anybody who is interested.

The talk mostly cover the following points:

  * What are the main characteristics and challenges of IoT Solutions? and how can Edge Computing help in solving them.
  * What&#8217;s Azure IoT Edge offering?
  * What&#8217;s the Azure IoT Edge Runtime?
  * What&#8217;s the role of the Azure IoT Edge Agent and the IoT Edge Hub?
  * When to use an Azure IoT Solution in the cloud and when to have the intelligence modules running on the Edge?
  * And also covering all the annoucements from Microsoft Build 2018 that are related to IoT and IoT Edge.

&nbsp;

The slides are here, and I hope you find them useful. If you have any questions or concerns, I would love to hear from you.
