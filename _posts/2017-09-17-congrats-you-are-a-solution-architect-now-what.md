Last week, I was fortunate enough to speak at <a href="https://dddperth.com/" target="_blank">DDDPerth</a>, which was a great conference and awesome and engaged audience. There were about ~ 350 people attending, with the amazing help of the organisers and volunteers. Here is the link to my slides, and I would love to hear your feedback: 



The feedback I got from people attended the conference was very positive 20 Green + 4 Yellow. Not bad, and I am happy with that. I loved the feedback provided by the yellow feedback submissions, and I will hope to improve my skills and my presentations for future conferences. 

The 2 demos I did on the day were 2 parts. 

**One**: The simplistic benchmark to choosing a storage unit on all cloud providers. The source code for this demo can be found on my GitHub, on <a href="https://github.com/has-taiar/dddPerth" target="_blank">this link</a>

**Second**: The second demo was on using tools like Conventional and Tailor. The source code for this demo was part of Andrew Best&#8217;s demos from his last talk &#8220;Conventional Wisdom&#8221;. Andrew is the creator and maintainer of Conventional. The link to the tools can be found on his GitHub account, <a href="https://github.com/andrewabest/Conventional.Samples" target="_blank">here is the link</a>
