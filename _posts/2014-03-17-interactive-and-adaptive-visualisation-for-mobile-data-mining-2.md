# Abstract

There is an emerging focus on real-time data stream analysis and visualisation onÂ mobile devices. The recent growth of smart phones capabilities has attracted manyÂ fields to port their applications to the mobile context. Examples of such mobile dataÂ analysis applications are patient monitoring, traffic monitoring, an stock marketÂ visualisation systems. Those types of applications require real-time analysis andÂ visualisation of continuous, and voluminous datasets. Users of those systems need toÂ make well-informed decisions in real-time based on the analysis of constant monitoring
  
on different sensors or other data sources. Thus, mining data streams on mobile devicesÂ is becoming increasingly an important field that is termed as Mobile/Ubiquitous DataÂ Mining (UDM).
  
UDM refers to the process of data analysis that is performed on portable and embeddedÂ devices in distributed environments where data is transmitted in form of a continuousÂ stream. Users, who are in a need for data stream analysis and visualisation in timeÂ critical scenarios, are the main target of UDM visualisation since it allows data miningÂ to be accessible anywhere at anytime. However, visualising the outcome of UDMÂ analysis on mobile devices faces many challenges due to the resources constraints andÂ the characteristics of display screens of mobile devices as well as the distinctiveÂ characteristics of data streams. While limited computational resources, small screenÂ space, and limited power supply are some of the limitations of mobile devices, data
  
streams also have challenging characterises such as being dynamic, changing, andÂ continuous.

Several resource-aware and adaptive strategies and algorithms have recently beenÂ developed for UDM. This trend has shaded the lights on UDM visualisation as it isÂ essential to quickly and appropriately understand the data analysis outcome. Clutter hasÂ been identified as a key issue in UDM visualisation, and clutter-adaptiv techniquesÂ have also been developed. However, visualising the continuous analysis of real-timeÂ data streams also requires adaptive, interactive, and user-driven style of presentation toÂ ensure accuracy and appropriate comprehension of the data visualisation for mobile
  
decision-making.

Therefore, in this thesis, we propose, develop, and evaluate interactive, adaptive,Â generic, and user-driven/controlled UDM visualisation strategies that extend the state-of-the-art clutter-aware UDM visualisation strategies. We have implemented and
  
experimentally evaluated the proposed framework to examine its effectiveness in termsÂ of clutter reduction, visualisation enhancement, and improving resource management.
  
The system was evaluated using publically available stock market data as well as geolocationsÂ dataset that was obtained by geo-coding addresses from the web. Finally, weÂ have provided demonstrations of the application, which has been made available on theÂ web and on the Google Android App-Store for free download to show the operation ofÂ our system. The outcomes of this dissertation have resulted in a Demo paper in ICDMÂ 2010, and a conference paper in ICTAI 2010.
