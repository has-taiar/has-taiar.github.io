    <h2>Congrats, you are a Solution Architect, now what?</h2>
    <p><em>September 25, 2017</em></p>
    <p>Last week, I was fortunate enough to speak at <a href="https://dddperth.com/" target="_blank">DDDPerth</a>, which was a great conference and awesome and engaged audience. There were about ~ 350 people attending, with the amazing help of the organisers and volunteers. Here is the link to my slides, and I would love to hear your feedback: </p>
<p>The feedback I got from people who attended the conference was very positive 20 Green + 4 Yellow. Not bad, and I am happy with that. I loved the feedback provided. All was constructive and supportive, and I will hope to improve my skills and my presentations for future conferences. </p>
<p>The 2 demos I did on the day were 2 parts. </p>
<p><strong>One</strong>: The simplistic benchmark to choosing a storage unit on all cloud providers. The source code for this demo can be found on my GitHub, on <a href="https://github.com/has-taiar/dddPerth" target="_blank">this link</a></p>
<p><strong>Second</strong>: The second demo was on using tools like Conventional and Tailor. The source code for this demo was part of Andrew Best&#8217;s demos from his last talk &#8220;Conventional Wisdom&#8221;. Andrew is the creator and maintainer of Conventional. The link to the tools can be found on his GitHub account, <a href="https://github.com/andrewabest/Conventional.Samples" target="_blank">here is the link</a></p>
