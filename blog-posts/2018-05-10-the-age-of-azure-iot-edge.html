<p>Azure IoT Edge is a great offering by Microsoft that simplifies building, deploying, and monitoring code modules for IoT Edge devices. Last night I gave a talk at Melbourne Azure meetup about Azure IoT Edge. I have put the slides here for anybody who is interested.</p>
<p>The talk mostly cover the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the main characteristics and challenges of IoT Solutions? and how can Edge Computing help in solving them.</li>
<li>What&#8217;s Azure IoT Edge offering?</li>
<li>What&#8217;s the Azure IoT Edge Runtime?</li>
<li>What&#8217;s the role of the Azure IoT Edge Agent and the IoT Edge Hub?</li>
<li>When to use an Azure IoT Solution in the cloud and when to have the intelligence modules running on the Edge?</li>
<li>And also covering all the annoucements from Microsoft Build 2018 that are related to IoT and IoT Edge.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The slides are here, and I hope you find them useful. If you have any questions or concerns, I would love to hear from you.</p>
