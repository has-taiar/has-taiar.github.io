<p>Here is the presentation of tonight&#8217;s talk. It was great to see so many passionate developers and business people at <a href="http://www.meetup.com/melbournemobile/" target="_blank">Melbourne Mobile</a>. I have embedded the slides below and I hope you find it useful. </p>
<h2>Talk Summary</h2>
<p>This presentation is basically a summary of what I have learned and the experience I have had going through my recent project. In trying to secure the users data on the mobile device, I have come to learn quite few common flaws in the security implementation, I have learned more reasons why you need to protect the data on your mobile app, and have come to know and use few useful open source projects. I share my experience from this project hoping that it would help you gain some insight and protect your mobile app data easily. </p>
<p>I said in the presentation that you could start securing the app data by a couple of lines of code and I do mean it. In fact, if you use <a href="https://components.xamarin.com/view/sqlcipher-for-xamarin-ios" target="_blank">SQLCipher</a>, then you could do that by only changing one line of code :). I have put the links to all my reference and the libraries I have used at the end of the slides. </p>
<p>Finally, just in case you do not like Prezi, here is the slides as a PDF file:</p>
